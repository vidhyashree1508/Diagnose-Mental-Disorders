Developing an expert system will be a good way to make sure the mental health clinics can diagnose the disorder mostly with verbal conversations with the patient or guardian rather than having to go with lab tests for each disorder. The verbal conversation will include the clinical staff asking the patient/guardian a set of questions which would be about symptoms and based on the answers obtained, the diagnosis can be done. Backward Chaining can be used for Diagnosis alongside decision tree and five important data structures. The answers given by the patient/guardian are compared to the available rules in the Knowledge Base and a diagnosis result is given. Once the diagnosis is done successfully, we can get the treatment using Forward Chaining.
